(ns kotoba.kessai
  "決済 (settlement/payment) — rail-agnostic payment-gateway abstraction, pure
  data contracts.

  A kotoba-lang capability library that gives any ISIC-vertical actor (credit,
  securities, insurance, ...) a single authorize/capture/refund/void port
  instead of a bespoke payment integration per actor. No network, no I/O.

  A PaymentRef is rail-agnostic: {:kessai/ref :kessai/rail :kessai/status
  :kessai/amount :kessai/currency :kessai/instrument}, :kessai/rail is
  :card | :wire, :kessai/status is one of :authorized | :declined | :failed |
  :captured | :refunded | :partially-refunded | :voided.

  Card-rail requests are built by kotoba.kessai.card (ISO 8583, via
  kotoba.card); wire-rail requests are built by kotoba.kessai.wire (ISO 20022
  pain.001 + BIC, via kotoba.banking). This namespace only knows the
  rail-agnostic port and the ledger tie-in (via kotoba.banking's double-entry
  postings) — it never touches ISO 8583/ISO 20022 shapes directly.

  Amounts are plain numbers in the smallest unit of the transaction currency
  (e.g. cents) — no BigDecimal assumption, keeping the library portable
  .cljc across JVM / ClojureScript / SCI / GraalVM."
