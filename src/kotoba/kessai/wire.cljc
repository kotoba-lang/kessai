  "Wire/SWIFT rail for kessai — ISO 20022 pain.001 (CustomerCreditTransferInitiation),
  bridging kotoba.swift's BIC (ISO 9362) validation and kotoba.banking's IBAN
  (ISO 13616) to kotoba.kessai's rail-agnostic PaymentRef. Does not
  reimplement BIC validation — that structural model already exists in
  kotoba-lang/swift and is reused as-is.

  XML is rendered via kotoba.swift.iso20022/pain001-doc + xml->str
  (ADR-2607142340) -- genuinely emitted, schema-verified-shape XML, not the
  hand-rolled string-splicing this namespace used before that library
  existed (see ADR-2607142340 Consequences, and its own follow-up note
  about migrating this namespace).

  Models a single credit-transfer instruction only (one PmtInf / one
  CdtTrfTxInf) — batched multi-transaction pain.001 messages, the pacs.008
  interbank leg, and camt.053 statements are a follow-up (see README).

  No network, no I/O — a real wire adapter sends the XML this namespace
  renders to a bank/SWIFT gateway, but that transport is a follow-up."

  (e.g. 10050). Assumes a 2-decimal currency -- the same assumption this
  namespace's `amount` field has always carried (its own tests and every
  known caller use 2-decimal codes like EUR/GBP). A currency needing 0 or 3
  decimal places (e.g. JPY, BHD) is out of scope here, the same class of
  honest, documented scope limit kotoba.swift.iso20022's own README states
  for its message-definition coverage -- not silently mishandled, just not

(defn- representable-in-2-decimals?
  "True when amount, multiplied by 100, is within float-precision epsilon of
  a whole number -- i.e. major->minor would not silently drop a fraction of
  a cent (e.g. 12.567 -> 1257, quietly discarding the 0.007). The OLD hand-
  rolled XML builder never converted units at all (it spliced the raw major-
  unit number as text), so it had no such precision-loss failure mode; this
  check exists specifically because migrating to integer-minor-unit amounts
  (as kotoba.swift.iso20022/pain001-doc requires) introduces one, and a
  financial amount silently losing sub-cent precision must fail loudly, not
  round away money. Reuses major->minor's own rounding (not a second,
  platform-specific implementation) so the two can never disagree."

(defn credit-transfer
  "Construct a single-transaction ISO 20022 pain.001 credit-transfer record.
  `msg-id`/`end-to-end-id` are caller-supplied idempotency keys; amount is a
  plain positive number in major units (e.g. 12.50); currency is an ISO 4217
  alpha-3 code. IBANs are validated via kotoba.banking/iban-valid?, BICs via
  kotoba.swift/bic-valid?.

  `debtor-name`, `creation-date-time` (ISO 8601 date-time), `payment-info-id`,
  and `requested-execution-date` (ISO 8601 date) are REQUIRED here -- they
  were silently omitted/left empty by this namespace's former hand-rolled
  XML builder (`<CreDtTm/>` and `<Dbtr><Nm/></Dbtr>` rendered empty), which
  kotoba.swift.iso20022/pain001-doc correctly refuses to do (returns nil for
  a missing required field rather than emitting an incomplete document).
  `charge-bearer` defaults to \"SLEV\" (same default as pain001-doc);
  `instruction-id`/`uetr`/`remittance-information` are optional pass-through.

  `amount` must be representable exactly in 2 decimal places (e.g. 12.567
  is rejected as :amount-not-representable-in-2-decimals) -- ->pain001-xml
  converts it to integer minor units, and a financial amount silently
  losing sub-cent precision must fail loudly, not round away money.
